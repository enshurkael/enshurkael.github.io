<h1>About This Project</h1>
<img src="logo.png" alt="Enshur-Kael Symbol"
     style="max-width:260px; display:block; margin:30px auto; opacity:0.9;">
<p>
<b>Enshur-Kael</b> is an independent research archive dedicated to the
systematic exploration of ancient medical knowledge, unexplained medical
phenomena, and theoretical frameworks that exist beyond modern clinical
models.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
The objective of this project is not treatment, diagnosis, or commercial
application. Instead, it serves as a structured intellectual space for
documenting historical insights, experimental ideas, comparative analysis,
and unresolved questions in medicine.
</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>
Research documented here is analytical, observational, and theoretical in
nature. Ancient texts, cross-cultural medical traditions, and individual
field observations are examined without predetermined conclusions.
</p>

<h2>Ethical Position</h2>

<p>
This platform does not offer medical advice. All material is presented for
academic discussion and research interest only. Readers are encouraged to
apply critical thinking and independent verification.
</p>

<h2>Authorship</h2>

<p>
This project is maintained anonymously to ensure intellectual freedom,
methodological honesty, and long-term continuity of inquiry without
institutional or ideological pressure.
