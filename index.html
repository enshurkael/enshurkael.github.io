    <i>An independent archive of ancient medical theories, observations, and unresolved questions.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    This platform documents independent research on ancient medicine, unexplained medical phenomena, and theoretical medical concepts.
    The focus is analytical, historical, and observational — not commercial or clinical.
  </p>
<h2>Central Question</h2>
<p>
Across ancient medical traditions, similar patterns appear in diagnosis, pulse interpretation,
temperament analysis, and disease progression.
Are these systems symbolic frameworks, empirical observations,
or early forms of pattern-based medicine?
</p>
  <h2>Method of Inquiry</h2>
<p>
This project follows a comparative and observational approach.
Ancient texts, cross-cultural medical systems, lived clinical observations,
and recurring symbolic patterns are examined side by side.
No single tradition is treated as absolute; emphasis is placed on convergence,
contradiction, and unexplained consistency.
